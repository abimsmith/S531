<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>

<p>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
</p>

<p>
"Beware the <b>Jabberwock</b>, my son!<br>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br>
</p>

<p>
He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
And stood awhile in thought.<br>
</p>

<p>
And as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
The Jabberwock, with <i>eyes of flame</i>,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
And burbled as it came!<br>
</p>

<p>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
He went galumphing back.<br>
</p>

<p>
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br>
He chortled in his joy.<br>
</p>

<p>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
</p>
